# Snake Game
This project was made using Java. Swing was used for the visual component, AWT for action listeners, and Javax Sound for the music. I composed this music using the Chrome Music Lab. Much of the project was completed with the help of a tutorial, which is mentioned in the comment of the main method in the source code, however the addition of music, increased difficulty as food is consumed, and a way to restart the game without quitting the application, are all my own work. 

# How to run
In order to run the application, search for "Releases" on the right column of this page. It should be under the "About" section. Here you will find a release called "Snake Game". Click on this to be directed to the releases window. On this page you will see "Release.zip" as well as the source code. fine. Download "Release.zip". You may be prompted with a message that asks if you trust the file. Depending on your operating system, you may have to look around to find the "Keep" or "Trust this file" option. Once you've done that, go to your Downloads folder and decompress the zip file (Extract all) wherever you'd like. Then, double-click the decompressed file and run Snake.exe. Enjoy!

# Have fun and enjoy!
